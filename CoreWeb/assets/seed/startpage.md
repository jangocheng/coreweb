## What is Piranha.Core

This is a **complete rewrite** of Piranha CMS for `NetStandard`. The goal of this rewrite 
is to create a version capable of targeting multiple platforms & frameworks with minimal
depenencies, but still provide a flexible & high performance CMS library.

Piranha is currently built for `NetStandard 2.0` and uses the following awesome packages:

* AutoMapper `6.1.1`
* Dapper `1.50.2`
* Markdig `0.13.1`
* Newtonsoft.Json `10.0.3`

## Licensing
Piranha CMS is released under the **MIT** license. It is a permissive free software license,
meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed
software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice.
