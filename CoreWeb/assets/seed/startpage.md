## What is Piranha.Core

This is a **complete rewrite** of Piranha CMS for `NetStandard`. The goal of this rewrite 
is to create a version capable of targeting multiple platforms & frameworks with minimal
depenencies, but still provide a flexible & high performance CMS library.

Piranha is currently built for `NetStandard 1.4` and uses the following awesome packages:

* AutoMapper `5.2.0`
* Dapper `1.50.2`
* Markdown `2.2.1`
* Newtonsoft.Json `9.0.1`

## Licensing
